## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
  - Responsive design principles and dynamic page interactions

- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js with Express for server-side operations  
  - PostgreSQL for data storage

## Installation & Setup

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bobby-99/CropSmart.git
cd CropSmart
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
```sh
npm install
```

### **3. Setup Environment Variables (Easier Method)**

Instead of requiring users to manually configure environment variables, we provide an `.env.example` file.  

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Modify `.env` only if necessary.

Alternatively, you can use SQLite for local development by changing the database configuration in the `server.js` file.

### **4. Run the Application**
```sh
npm start
```
Your server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. Open the project in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

- **Crop Analysis:**  
  Navigate to the Crop Analysis page to input soil nutrient and environmental data. The tool will process your inputs and display recommended crops with confidence scores and supporting data visualizations.

- **Fertilizer Recommendations:**  
  Use the Fertilizer Suggestions page to get fertilizer recommendations based on your soil analysis. The system compares input data with a preloaded dataset to provide tailored advice.

- **User Management:**  
  Register for an account or log in using the dedicated authentication pages. This ensures that your analysis history and recommendations are stored and personalized.
